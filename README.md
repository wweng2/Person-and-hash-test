# Person-and-hash-test

This program is a test of a hash table and see what if the program is able to deal with adding person objects to a hashtable and see if the program automattically adds the object the next avaiable space
on the table. 

The test starts by having the program make a hash table whith a random amount of spots based on normal distrbution rates and insert objects to it.
This then should be able to prevent duplcate data from being inserted and allows for deletion of data that automacally adjust the table so the data is in right spots and no werid empty space in the table.
